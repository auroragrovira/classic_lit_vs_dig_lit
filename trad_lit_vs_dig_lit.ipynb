En principio, los primeros presentan mayor oralidad, uso de emojis, frases más breves, etc. No obstante, estas afirmaciones suelen formularse de manera intuitiva a partir de una impresión subjetiva cualitativa no dirigida, o sin aparato metodológico.\n","\n","Este proyecto tiene como objetivo comprobar empíricamente algunas de estas diferencias a partir de la comparación entre un texto tradicional, o clásico, y un texto narrativo nativo digital. En este caso, se usan el primer capítulo de dos obras pertenecientes a uno y otro ámbito: Los juegos del hambre de Suzanne Collins, un clásico contemporáneo, y A Desperate Vow de Emara88, un fanfiction publicado en la plataforma fanfiction.net.\n","\n","Mediante un análisis automático sencillo, se calculan métricas básicas de complejidad textual, como la longitud media de palabra y de frase (tokens y types). Además, se cuantifican ciertos rasgos considerados característicos de la escritura digital, como el uso de emojis y signos de exclamación o alargamientos gráficos de algunas palabras. A partir de estos resultados, se busca describir de manera más precisa en qué medida el texto digital se aleja del modelo narratico tradicional y qué implicaciones puede tener eesto para el estudio de la literatura digital.\n","\n","Así pues, se pretende aportar una herramienta cuantitativa que refute o apoye los análisis comparativos cualitativos entre textos nacidos en entornos distintos. Incluso, podría ser útil para la clasificación de los distintos entornos digitales según la calidad literaria o la oralidad y expresividad gráfica de cada uno, puesto que, en principio, son conceptos opuestos."],"metadata":{"id":"Je3m7yDbEonA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Datos usados:\n","\n","Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.

My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim’s warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping. I prop myself up on one elbow. There’s enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my mother’s body, their cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim’s face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother was very beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me. Sitting at Prim’s knees, guarding her, is the world’s ugliest cat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of rotting squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. He hates me. Or at least distrusts me. Even though it was years ago, I think he still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when Prim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly swollen with worms, crawling with fleas. The last thing I needed was another mouth to feed. But Prim begged so hard, cried even, I had to let him stay. It turned out okay. My mother got rid of the vermin and he’s a born mouser. Even catches the occasional rat. Sometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the entrails. He has stopped hissing at me. Entrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever come to love. I swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots. Supple leather that has molded to my feet. I pull on trousers, a shirt, tuck my long dark braid up into a cap, and grab my forage bag. On the table, under a wooden bowl to protect it from hungry rats and cats alike, sits a perfect little goat cheese wrapped in basil leaves. Prim’s gift to me on reaping day. I put the cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip outside. Our part of District 12, nicknamed the Seam, is usually crawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at this hour. Men and women with hunched shoulders, swollen knuckles, many who have long since stopped trying to scrub the coal dust out of their broken nails, the lines of their sunken faces. But today the black cinder streets are empty. Shutters on the squat gray houses are closed. The reaping isn’t until two. May as well sleep in. If you can. Our house is almost at the edge of the Seam. I only have to pass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow. Separating the Meadow from the woods, in fact enclosing all of District 12, is a high chain-link fence topped with barbed-wire loops. In theory, it’s supposed to be electrified twenty-four hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the woods — packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, bears — that used to threaten our streets. But since we’re lucky to get two or three hours of electricity in the evenings, it’s usually safe to touch. Even so, I always take a moment to listen carefully for the hum that means the fence is live. Right now, it’s silent as a stone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out on my belly and slide under a two-foot stretch that’s been loose for years. There are several other weak spots in the fence, but this one is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here. As soon as I’m in the trees, I retrieve a bow and sheath of arrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh-eaters out of District 12. Inside the woods they roam freely, and there are added concerns like venomous snakes, rabid animals, and no real paths to follow. But there’s also food if you know how to find it. My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing even to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for him to run. Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poaching carries the severest of penalties, more people would risk it if they had weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife. My bow is a rarity, crafted by my father along with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods, carefully wrapped in waterproof covers. My father could have made good money selling them, but if the officials found out he would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion. Most of the Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who hunt because they’re as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is. In fact, they’re among our best customers. But the idea that someone might be arming the Seam would never have been allowed. In the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harvest apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. Always close enough to run back to the safety of District 12 if trouble arises. “District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety,” I mutter. Then I glance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might overhear you. When I was younger, I scared my mother to death, the things I would blurt out about District 12, about the people who rule our country, Panem, from the far-off city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only polite small talk in the public market. Discuss little more than trades in the Hob, which is the black market where I make most of my money. Even at home, where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing tricky topics. Like the reaping, or food shortages, or the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be? In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself. Gale. I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing, my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place, a rock ledge overlooking a valley. A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The sight of him waiting there brings on a smile. Gale says I never smile except in the woods. “Hey, Catnip,” says Gale. My real name is Katniss, but when I first told him, I had barely whispered it. So he thought I’d said Catnip. Then when this crazy lynx started following me around the woods looking for handouts, it became his official nickname for me. I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off game. I almost regretted it because he wasn’t bad company. But I got a decent price for his pelt. “Look what I shot,” Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an arrow stuck in it, and I laugh. It’s real bakery bread, not the flat, dense loaves we make from our grain rations. I take it in my hands, pull out the arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust to my nose, inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood with saliva. Fine bread like this is for special occasions. “Mm, still warm,” I say. He must have been at the bakery at the crack of dawn to trade for it. “What did it cost you?” “Just a squirrel. Think the old man was feeling sentimental this morning,” says Gale. “Even wished me luck.” “Well, we all feel a little closer today, don’t we?” I say, not even bothering to roll my eyes. “Prim left us a cheese.” I pull it out. His expression brightens at the treat. “Thank you, Prim. We’ll have a real feast.” Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent as he mimics Effie Trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who arrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping. “I almost forgot! Happy Hunger Games!” He plucks a few blackberries from the bushes around us. “And may the odds —” He tosses a berry in a high arc toward me. I catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my teeth. The sweet tartness explodes across my tongue. “— be ever in your favor!” I finish with equal verve. We have to joke about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your wits. Besides, the Capitol accent is so affected, almost anything sounds funny in it. I watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread. He could be my brother. Straight black hair, olive skin, we even have the same gray eyes. But we’re not related, at least not closely. Most of the families who work the mines resemble one another this way. That’s why my mother and Prim, with their light hair and blue eyes, always look out of place. They are. My mother’s parents were part of the small merchant class that caters to officials, Peacekeepers, and the occasional Seam customer. They ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of District 12. Since almost no one can afford doctors, apothecaries are our healers. My father got to know my mother because on his hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell them to her shop to be brewed into remedies. She must have really loved him to leave her home for the Seam. I try to remember that when all I can see is the woman who sat by, blank and unreachable, while her children turned to skin and bones. I try to forgive her for my father’s sake. But to be honest, I’m not the forgiving type. Gale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese, carefully placing a basil leaf on each while I strip the bushes of their berries. We settle back in a nook in the rocks. From this place, we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley, which is teeming with summer life, greens to gather, roots to dig, fish iridescent in the sunlight. The day is glorious, with a blue sky and soft breeze. The food’s wonderful, with the cheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting in our mouths. Everything would be perfect if this really was a holiday, if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains with Gale, hunting for tonight’s supper. But instead we have to be standing in the square at two o’clock waiting for the names to be called out. “We could do it, you know,” Gale says quietly. “What?” I ask. “Leave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we could make it,” says Gale. I don’t know how to respond. The idea is so preposterous. “If we didn’t have so many kids,” he adds quickly. They’re not our kids, of course. But they might as well be. Gale’s two little brothers and a sister. Prim. And you may as well throw in our mothers, too, because how would they live without us? Who would fill those mouths that are always asking for more? With both of us hunting daily, there are still nights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or wool, still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growling. “I never want to have kids,” I say. “I might. If I didn’t live here,” says Gale. “But you do,” I say, irritated. “Forget it,” he snaps back. The conversation feels all wrong. Leave? How could I leave Prim, who is the only person in the world I’m certain I love? And Gale is devoted to his family. We can’t leave, so why bother talking about it? And even if we did . . . even if we did . . . where did this stuff about having kids come from? There’s never been anything romantic between Gale and me. When we met, I was a skinny twelve-year-old, and although he was only two years older, he already looked like a man. It took a long time for us to even become friends, to stop haggling over every trade and begin helping each other out. Besides, if he wants kids, Gale won’t have any trouble finding a wife. He’s good-looking, he’s strong enough to handle the work in the mines, and he can hunt. You can tell by the way the girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that they want him. It makes me jealous but not for the reason people would think. Good hunting partners are hard to find. “What do you want to do?” I ask. We can hunt, fish, or gather. “Let’s fish at the lake. We can leave our poles and gather in the woods. Get something nice for tonight,” he says. Tonight. After the reaping, everyone is supposed to celebrate. And a lot of people do, out of relief that their children have been spared for another year. But at least two families will pull their shutters, lock their doors, and try to figure out how they will survive the painful weeks to come. We make out well. The predators ignore us on a day when easier, tastier prey abounds. By late morning, we have a dozen fish, a bag of greens and, best of all, a gallon of strawberries. I found the patch a few years ago, but Gale had the idea to string mesh nets around it to keep out the animals. On the way home, we swing by the Hob, the black market that operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal. When they came up with a more efficient system that transported the coal directly from the mines to the trains, the Hob gradually took over the space. Most businesses are closed by this time on reaping day, but the black market’s still fairly busy. We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, the other two for salt. Greasy Sae, the bony old woman who sells bowls of hot soup from a large kettle, takes half the greens off our hands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin. We might do a tad better elsewhere, but we make an effort to keep on good terms with Greasy Sae. She’s the only one who can consistently be counted on to buy wild dog. We don’t hunt them on purpose, but if you’re attacked and you take out a dog or two, well, meat is meat. “Once it’s in the soup, I’ll call it beef,” Greasy Sae says with a wink. No one in the Seam would turn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog, but the Peacekeepers who come to the Hob can afford to be a little choosier. When we finish our business at the market, we go to the back door of the mayor’s house to sell half the strawberries, knowing he has a particular fondness for them and can afford our price. The mayor’s daughter, Madge, opens the door. She’s in my year at school. Being the mayor’s daughter, you’d expect her to be a snob, but she’s all right. She just keeps to herself. Like me. Since neither of us really has a group of friends, we seem to end up together a lot at school. Eating lunch, sitting next to each other at assemblies, partnering for sports activities. We rarely talk, which suits us both just fine. Today her drab school outfit has been replaced by an expensive white dress, and her blonde hair is done up with a pink ribbon. Reaping clothes. “Pretty dress,” says Gale. Madge shoots him a look, trying to see if it’s a genuine compliment or if he’s just being ironic. It is a pretty dress, but she would never be wearing it ordinarily. She presses her lips together and then smiles. “Well, if I end up going to the Capitol, I want to look nice, don’t I?” Now it’s Gale’s turn to be confused. Does she mean it? Or is she messing with him? I’m guessing the second. “You won’t be going to the Capitol,” says Gale coolly. His eyes land on a small, circular pin that adorns her dress. Real gold. Beautifully crafted. It could keep a family in bread for months. “What can you have? Five entries? I had six when I was just twelve years old.” “That’s not her fault,” I say. “No, it’s no one’s fault. Just the way it is,” says Gale. Madge’s face has become closed off. She puts the money for the berries in my hand. “Good luck, Katniss.” “You, too,” I say, and the door closes. We walk toward the Seam in silence. I don’t like that Gale took a dig at Madge, but he’s right, of course. The reaping system is unfair, with the poor getting the worst of it. You become eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve. That year, your name is entered once. At thirteen, twice. And so on and so on until you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of eligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven times. That’s true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire country of Panem. But here’s the catch. Say you are poor and starving as we were. You can opt to add your name more times in exchange for tesserae. Each tessera is worth a meager year’s supply of grain and oil for one person. You may do this for each of your family members as well. So, at the age of twelve, I had my name entered four times. Once, because I had to, and three times for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my mother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. And the entries are cumulative. So now, at the age of sixteen, my name will be in the reaping twenty times. Gale, who is eighteen and has been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of five for seven years, will have his name in forty-two times. You can see why someone like Madge, who has never been at risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. The chance of her name being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who live in the Seam. Not impossible, but slim. And even though the rules were set up by the Capitol, not the districts, certainly not Madge’s family, it’s hard not to resent those who don’t have to sign up for tesserae. Gale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On other days, deep in the woods, I’ve listened to him rant about how the tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our district. A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of the Seam and those who can generally count on supper and thereby ensure we will never trust one another. “It’s to the Capitol’s advantage to have us divided among ourselves,” he might say if there were no ears to hear but mine. If it wasn’t reaping day. If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not made what I’m sure she thought was a harmless comment. As we walk, I glance over at Gale’s face, still smoldering underneath his stony expression. His rages seem pointless to me, although I never say so. It’s not that I don’t agree with him. I do. But what good is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of the woods? It doesn’t change anything. It doesn’t make things fair. It doesn’t fill our stomachs. In fact, it scares off the nearby game. I let him yell though. Better he does it in the woods than in the district. Gale and I divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple of loaves of good bread, greens, a quart of strawberries, salt, paraffin, and a bit of money for each. “See you in the square,” I say. “Wear something pretty,” he says flatly. At home, I find my mother and sister are ready to go. My mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days. Prim is in my first reaping outfit, a skirt and ruffled blouse. It’s a bit big on her, but my mother has made it stay with pins. Even so, she’s having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back. A tub of warm water waits for me. I scrub off the dirt and sweat from the woods and even wash my hair. To my surprise, my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me. A soft blue thing with matching shoes. “Are you sure?” I ask. I’m trying to get past rejecting offers of help from her. For a while, I was so angry, I wouldn’t allow her to do anything for me. And this is something special. Her clothes from her past are very precious to her. “Of course. Let’s put your hair up, too,” she says. I let her towel-dry it and braid it up on my head. I can hardly recognize myself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall. “You look beautiful,” says Prim in a hushed voice. “And nothing like myself,” I say. I hug her, because I know these next few hours will be terrible for her. Her first reaping. She’s about as safe as you can get, since she’s only entered once. I wouldn’t let her take out any tesserae. But she’s worried about me. That the unthinkable might happen. I protect Prim in every way I can, but I’m powerless against the reaping. The anguish I always feel when she’s in pain wells up in my chest and threatens to register on my (ace. I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm. “Tuck your tail in, little duck,” I say, smoothing the blouse back in place. Prim giggles and gives me a small “Quack.” “Quack yourself,” I say with a light laugh. The kind only Prim can draw out of me. “Come on, let’s eat,” I say and plant a quick kiss on the top of her head. The fish and greens are already cooking in a stew, but that will be for supper. We decide to save the strawberries and bakery bread for this evening’s meal, to make it special we say. Instead we drink milk from Prim’s goat, Lady, and eat the rough bread made from the tessera grain, although no one has much appetite anyway. At one o’clock, we head for the square. Attendance is mandatory unless you are on death’s door. This evening, officials will come around and check to see if this is the case. If not, you’ll be imprisoned. It’s too bad, really, that they hold the reaping in the square — one of the few places in District 12 that can be pleasant. The square’s surrounded by shops, and on public market days, especially if there’s good weather, it has a holiday feel to it. But today, despite the bright banners hanging on the buildings, there’s an air of grimness. The camera crews, perched like buzzards on rooftops, only add to the effect. People file in silently and sign in. The reaping is a good opportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the population as well. Twelve-through eighteen-year-olds are herded into roped areas marked off by ages, the oldest in the front, the young ones, like Prim, toward the back. Family members line up around the perimeter, holding tightly to one another’s hands. But there are others, too, who have no one they love at stake, or who no longer care, who slip among the crowd, taking bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn. Odds are given on their ages, whether they’re Seam or merchant, if they will break down and weep. Most refuse dealing with the racketeers but carefully, carefully. These same people tend to be informers, and who hasn’t broken the law? I could be shot on a daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of those in charge protect me. Not everyone can claim the same. Anyway, Gale and I agree that if we have to choose between dying of hunger and a bullet in the head, the bullet would be much quicker. The space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people arrive. The square’s quite large, but not enough to hold District 12’s population of about eight thousand. Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets, where they can watch the event on screens as it’s televised live by the state. I find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the Seam. We all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the temporary stage that is set up before the Justice Building. It holds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for the boys and one for the girls. I stare at the paper slips in the girls’ ball. Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on them in careful handwriting. Two of the three chairs fill with Madge’s father, Mayor Undersee, who’s a tall, balding man, and Effie Trinket, District 12’s escort, fresh from the Capitol with her scary white grin, pinkish hair, and spring green suit. They murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat. Just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to the podium and begins to read. It’s the same story every year. He tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America. He lists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land, the brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, the uprising of the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and, as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games. The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute standing wins. Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one another while we watch — this is the Capitol’s way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion. Whatever words they use, the real message is clear. “Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and there’s nothing you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you. Just as we did in District Thirteen.” To make it humiliating as well as torturous, the Capitol requires us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity, a sporting event pitting every district against the others. The last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home, and their district will be showered with prizes, largely consisting of food. All year, the Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation. “It is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks,” intones the mayor. Then he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In seventy-four years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive. Haymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle-aged man, who at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible, staggers onto the stage, and falls into the third chair. He’s drunk. Very. The crowd responds with its token applause, but he’s confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she barely manages to fend off. The mayor looks distressed. Since all of this is being televised, right now District 12 is the laughingstock of Panem, and he knows it. He quickly tries to pull the attention back to the reaping by introducing Effie Trinket. Bright and bubbly as ever, Effie Trinket trots to the podium and gives her signature, “Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor!” Her pink hair must be a wig because her curls have shifted slightly off-center since her encounter with Haymitch. She goes on a bit about what an honor it is to be here, although everyone knows she’s just aching to get bumped up to a better district where they have proper victors, not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation. Through the crowd, I spot Gale looking back at me with a ghost of a smile. As reapings go, this one at least has a slight entertainment factor. But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and his forty-two names in that big glass ball and how the odds are not in his favor. Not compared to a lot of the boys. And maybe he’s thinking the same thing about me because his face darkens and he turns away. “But there are still thousands of slips,” I wish I could whisper to him. It’s time for the drawing. Effie Trinket says as she always does, “Ladies first!” and crosses to the glass ball with the girls’ names. She reaches in, digs her hand deep into the ball, and pulls out a slip of paper. The crowd draws in a collective breath and then you can hear a pin drop, and I’m feeling nauseous and so desperately hoping that it’s not me, that it’s not me, that it’s not me. Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes the slip of paper, and reads out the name in a clear voice. And it’s not me. It’s Primrose Everdeen.]\n","\"\"\"\n","#Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.

Let me know what you think!

After a long day at work, he'd been more than ready to pack his bags and go home. It'd been a day full of meeting after meeting as they signed the contracts for a new venture they were exploring. He'd been swarmed by an endless stream of lawyers tidying up every last detail of the contract for hours now.\n","Malfoy Enterprises had grown in leaps and bounds these last few years. Once he'd trimmed the company's less reputable connections down and removed the corruption that had been prolific under Lucius's tenure as director, he'd finally been able to capitalise on its potential. With the economic boom that had begun shortly after the war, he'd made some smart investments in new start-ups and markets, and now it was one of the most successful companies in wizarding Britain.\n","His mood that day had been optimistic, buoyant even. And now this.\n","Theodore Nott sat opposite him, shuffling some papers around as he laid out the forms that the Ministry of Magic had sent over via owl that afternoon.\n","\"So that's it? The appeal was just…denied?\" Theo nodded with a sneer.\n","\"Bloody bastards,\" the other man quipped as he drew out the correct document from the bundle, \"Here – you can see for yourself what their justification was...\"\n","Draco snatched the paper and devoured the lines that Theo had highlighted with a tab. His hands were shaking with anger as he read it aloud.\n","The Ministry of Magic Prisoner Reform Program hereby DENIES the appeal for the release of Prisoner 36743, Narcissa Aurora Malfoy into familial custody.\n","The Wizengamot appreciates that the prisoner has shown evidence of personal rehabilitation, however it is clear that the nominated representative from her immediate family* does not currently meet the requirements for\n","acting as a parole custodian. It is the opinion of this court that Mr D. Malfoy's own former ties to the group\n","formerly known as the Death Eaters makes him an unsuitable candidate to take custody of the prisoner for the duration of her parole period.\n","*Note: No other immediate family available as substitute. Sincerely,\n","Mafalda Hopkirk\n","Draco scrunched the parchment up and threw it with deadly accuracy into the fireplace nearby, slamming his hand down onto his desk in anger as he watched the paper burn with a grim satisfaction. Theo raised one eyebrow questioningly, gesturing to another sheet nearby.\n","\n","\"Good thing I already made copies,\" he muttered, observing his friend and waiting for the inevitable tide of outrage that would come.\n","\"What the bloody hell am I supposed to do now?\" Draco yelled, standing up and starting to pace across the mantle. \"You may just have to wait. Your mother only has five more years left on her sentence…\"\n","\"She won't survive another five years! You saw her last week; that place is killing her.\"\n","\"We tried appealing on medical grounds already,\" Theo sighed, \"Apparently the Wizengamot feel that chronic pneumonia isn't deadly enough to warrant action. Wankers.\"\n","Draco leaned against the fireplace, cradling his head in his hands.\n","\"She's dying, Theo! She doesn't deserve this. My mother was forced into this bloody mess just as much as I was. But because she wasn't a minor at the time she gets Azkaban and I get pardoned? It's not fair.\"\n","Draco tried to take a deep breath to calm himself. He'd been fighting this battle for years. It had been six years since the final battle that had seen the end of Voldemort. It had been more than five years since the ministry had aggressively prosecuted all the former death eaters and purged the wizarding world of their evil.\n","Draco had been very lucky indeed. If it hadn't been for the reluctant testimony of Harry Potter, he wouldn't have made it at all, he knew. But his mother had not been so fortunate. She had housed the Dark Lord in her own home for months. All the events that had taken place at Malfoy Manor could be tied back to her as the manor's hostess, no matter how little she'd actually wanted to be involved. And with Lucius killed during that final battle there was nobody else to blame. She was a scapegoat of sorts.\n","But she certainly didn't deserve to die a slow, painful death behind bars.\n","And now he was being told that he was the reason she couldn't be released. They'd pursued this new reform eagerly when it had been announced. It allowed low-risk prisoners with pristine records to be released to an immediate family member for a parole period. But because of his own murky past, he now wasn't good enough to be her custodian?\n","Draco wanted to throw something else in anger, or better yet storm down to the Ministry and start hexing people.\n","Instead he collapsed into his chair once more, his elbows landing on his expensive mahogany desk with a distinctive thunk. \"What am I going to do now?\" he groaned.\n","Theo contemplated his notes for a while, his expression thoughtful. The other former Slytherin student had been his close friend now for many years. Both of them knew what it was like to have a sadistic murdering bastard for a father. After the war had ended they had rekindled their casual acquaintance from school and it had grown into a genuine friendship. When Theo had received his legal degree from Pendragon University, Draco had immediately hired him as his personal attorney. The other man was clever, cunning and never gave up until he'd won. A consummate Slytherin.\n","Theo leaned back, observing Draco over his linked fingers as he took a steady breath.\n","\"Well… I suppose there are really only two viable solutions if you're determined to get her out on a custody bond.\" \"What are they?\" he asked eagerly.\n","Theo held up his index and middle fingers to count the two options as he spoke.\n","\"Option number one – you find the right person to bribe or blackmail in the Wizengamot. It's illegal, obviously, and carries some risk of being arrested yourself... but it's a tried and tested method I'm sure your father used on numerous occasions.\"\n","Draco closed his eyes for a moment as his heart thudded. The thought of doing something so corrupt, something so much like\n","Lucius would have done made him feel sick. \"And the other option?\"\n","\"Simple. Clean up your image.\" Draco gave him a dubious look.\n","\"Theo, I'm one of the richest bloody people in Britain and I employ hundreds of wizards and witches across my different companies. I treat my employees well. I make profits honestly and ethically. I don't smoke or drink to excess. I don't sleep around. What more do they want? All they see is this.\"\n","He pushed up his sleeve impatiently. The dark mark was no longer quite so black as it used to be, but it was still very evident there, seared onto his skin forever.\n","Theo clucked his tongue, pointing at the mark with a jab of his finger.\n","\"Exactly! This is about your moral image. Yes you were a Death Eater, willingly or not. So you need to do something to change that perception.\"\n","\"Like what?\" he growled.\n","\"You could give a big donation to that Muggleborn Restitution charity? Or start an organisation to help war veterans or something?\"\n","\n","\"It can't be that easy,\" Draco grumbled, \"and anyway, it's not like I go around kicking puppies or anything. I give plenty of money to charity.\"\n","\"Yes but you still come across as just so… pureblood.\"\n","Theo said the word sarcastically, with a quirk of his eyebrows. The term had almost become an insult in the years following the war. The wizarding world had changed a lot since then, mostly for the better.\n","\"It is rather trendy to adopt a more muggle lifestyle,\" he agreed, wondering how on earth he could do so in a short space of time, quick enough to save his mother from her hellish situation.\n","The two friends were quiet for a while, both contemplating the question. Then Theo suddenly snorted and slapped his hand to his forehead.\n","\"Now that's an idea…\" his friend exclaimed thoughtfully as a mischievous grin stretched his lips like the cat that got the canary. \"What?\" Draco asked with a trickle of apprehension.\n","\"Oh you're not going to like it. But it certainly would be the easiest and most effective strategy!\" \"What is it Theo?\" he demanded.\n","\"You could just marry a muggleborn!\"\n","There was an awkward pause after Theo had announced this, during which Draco looked at him darkly. \"What?\"\n","\"Don't look at me like that! It's an ideal solution.\" \"You've gone insane.\"\n","Theo grinned, leaning forwards eagerly.\n","\"Come on, surely you're not still pretending you're put off by muggleborns are you?\"\n","\"Of course not! But how exactly do you expect me to find a decent muggleborn witch, date her, fall in love and get married all in time to save my mother from certain death?\"\n","Theo scoffed loudly, rolling his eyes.\n","\"Fall in love? What are you, twelve years old? You can just pay someone to marry you.\" Draco gave him a look of disgust.\n","\"Pay someone? Are you out of your mind?\"\n","\"Well why not? It would just be a contract! A business arrangement. It wouldn't have to be a real marriage or anything. You can stage the wedding, pay the witch an allowance for a couple of years, then get divorced.\"\n","Draco actually threw his hands in the air, feeling thrown by the suggestion. \"That's crazy! It's totally out of the question.\"\n","\"It would work, I bet,\" Theo insisted, gesturing down at the papers in front of him, \"then you'd have someone in the household who directly contradicted your image as a former death eater. An actual muggleborn witch! An heroic survivor of the war against You-Know-Who!\"\n","\"Enough!\" Draco yelled with a disbelieving expression, \"I am not marrying some stranger and paying her to keep quiet!\" Theo sighed.\n","\"Alright, but for the record it's a brilliant idea.\" \"It really isn't!\"\n","The other man shrugged.\n","\"You may as well. It's not like you give any other witch the time of day. All these years you've barely dated anyone.\" \"I've been busy! I've been building this company back up from the cesspool Lucius created-\"\n","\"Still! You could have dated a bit more. There have been plenty of witches who've shown an interest.\" Draco snorted, running his hands through his hair.\n","\"And every time you've set me up with one, they've always been the same. Boring. Desperate. Or just plain stupid. Why can't you find me a woman who can hold a decent conversation?\"\n","Theo looked at him like he was crazy.\n","\"Conversation? Now I know you've got issues. Just have some fun!\"\n","\n","Draco sighed and looked towards the fireplace. \"Easier said than done.\"\n","Theo stood and began to gather the documents together into a pile.\n","\"Well you're going to have to agree to something. I'll look into our options, bend the ear of some court officials and see whether a few charitable donations would be enough to help. Otherwise… you might need to consider 'Plan B' a little more seriously.\"\n","Draco tiredly rubbed at his eyes.\n","\"Merlin I hope it doesn't come to that… I can only imagine in my worst nightmares the kind of desperate witch you'd have me marry in that scenario.\"\n","Theo just laughed as he left the office, calling back over his shoulder,\n","\"You'd be surprised what money can buy, Draco my man! Just wait and see!\"\n","…\n","…\n","...\n","Hermione sat nervously in the sterile hospital room, staring blankly at the four white walls around her. There were a couple of bland landscape paintings adorning the walls, but otherwise there was nothing to occupy her mind. Instead she ran through a list of things she needed to buy for the week.\n","Groceries, a new pair of shoes, that phone bill…\n","Doing the maths in her head, she wondered how much would be left over. Not enough.\n","\"Miss Granger?\"\n","With a jolt of surprise, Hermione realised that someone was calling her name. The nurse smiled at her distraction and led her down the hallway and into one of the pristine consultation rooms. St Mungo's was a sprawling maze of different wings and wards. She'd completely lost track of where they'd sent her today.\n","As she waited for the medi-witch to arrive, she sighed, fidgeting with one loose curl that had escaped her braid.\n","What a lot of fuss, she huffed to herself, all over a simple fall. She admitted she'd been eating rather poorly lately, and had clearly been dehydrated and under a lot of stress. Was it really any surprise that she'd collapsed in the middle of the local park yesterday afternoon?\n","A rushed trip to the hospital and a few unnecessary tests later and she was home and fine again! So why was she being called back today? There were definitely better things she could be doing with her time.\n","Hermione drummed her fingers impatiently on the table top in front of her.\n","She supposed it was Sophie who'd finally convinced her to go to this appointment. Her daughter had been terribly upset and distressed by yesterday's events. She'd sat next to her mother sobbing hysterically until someone had been alerted and had come over to help. Fortunately a kindly neighbour had been nearby to hear the little girl's screams.\n","And as much time as she'd spent reassuring her daughter last night that she was fine, she knew little Sophie was too stubborn to let it drop until she had incontrovertible proof.\n","They only had each other, after all.\n","And Sophie was like a protective little lioness.\n","Hermione loved her daughter more than anything on this earth. To say she was a bit of a surprise was an understatement. She certainly hadn't been planning to have a child at the very young age of twenty. But it seemed that fate (and one faulty contraceptive potion) had other ideas. And now she wouldn't have it any other way.\n","Her thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of a Medi-Witch, her bright lime robes swishing around her portly form as she came in to sit opposite Hermione. The woman had a kindly but serious expression on her face.\n","\"Good afternoon, Miss Granger. I'm Doctor Seeley. Thank you for making the time so soon to come in.\"\n","\"Of course,\" she replied politely, \"I just want to get this over with to be honest. I've certainly learned my lesson about skipping breakfast.\"\n","The Medi-Witch sighed, leaning forwards to lace her fingers together.\n","\"Miss Granger… the tests done yesterday would indicate that there is something else going on. I read through your records. There were some notes made by your obstetrician from when you were pregnant. For how long before that had you been experiencing dizzy episodes? Muscle spasms?\"\n","Hermione blinked in surprise, thinking of the tremors she would get in her fingers occasionally, her terrible headaches and the cramps she suffered in her arms and legs.\n","\n","\"Uh…well… it's been about six years or so in total now.\"\n","\"Six years,\" the doctor repeated thoughtfully, her quill taking notes independently as she observed her patient thoughtfully over her interlaced fingers, \"Forgive me for asking, Miss Granger but, knowing you of course by reputation, is it possible that these symptoms could be linked to an injury sustained during the war?\"\n","Hermione swallowed, squirming a bit uncomfortably in her seat.\n","\"Well…maybe, I guess. The tremors started sometime after…I think… well, there was this one incident…\"\n","Her stammering voice trailed off as she choked on the words, the memories overwhelming her a bit as she gathered her courage.\n","\"I believe you were tortured by Death Eaters,\" the doctor prompted gently, \"If indeed the many stories written after the war are to be believed,\" she added.\n","Hermione nodded. She drew in a deep breath and answered weakly, \"Yes but… but it's been years since then…\"\n","The doctor nodded with a grimace.\n","\"Indeed. However, there are certain curses that can continue to produce complications years later. Especially after a single, prolonged exposure. The body fights back at first and can succeed for a while. But these things cause damage we might not be able to see or even feel at first that re-emerge later.\"\n","\"So…what does that mean? What's wrong with me exactly?\"\n","Doctor Seeley leaned back in her chair. Her expression was tender but professional as she observed her patient.\n","\"Let me be frank, Miss Granger. I was called in by my colleagues after your tests came back yesterday due to the nature of your illness.\"\n","\"My… my illness?\"\n","The Medi-Witch nodded solemnly.\n","\"I specialise in Terminal Curse Wounds. I often help patients to assess their options and cope with trauma caused by inoperable masses of dark magic.\"\n","\"Woah… hold on. What the hell are you talking about?\"\n","\"Miss Granger… Hermione,\" she said more softly, showing some sympathy in her features now as she leaned forwards, \"the torture you endured has left a dark mass in your brain. It's probably been growing there for years. It's spread through your core magic and is also infecting your nervous system. Am I right in assuming you don't actually use magic very much?\"\n","\"Uh…no,\" she answered blankly, \"I mean yes… I hardly ever use magic at home. I'm…I'm a…\"\n","\"It's quite common for muggleborn witches and wizards to use less magic in their day-to-day lives. It's likely that living a more muggle lifestyle has actually helped prolong your good health this long. Increased magic use may have allowed the darkness to spread more rapidly.\"\n","Hermione knew her mind was shutting down in several key areas as she tried to absorb all this. She felt fuzzy and confused.\n","\"But… but what can we do about it? How do we get rid of it?\" she asked in a shaky voice. The Medi-witch paused for a moment as if giving her time to prepare.\n","\"There is currently no viable option to remove the mass using surgery or aggressive anti-curse spells. It's too intricately wrapped around your brain and any attempt to do so might prove fatal.\"\n","\"What are you saying?\" she asked desperately, her head spinning wildly, \"what can we do then?\" Doctor Seeley sighed, pursing her lips sadly.\n","\"Your best course of action is starting a treatment of potions to try and reduce the spread. But I should stress that it is likely to only give you more time…\"\n","Hermione's body began to feel numb. As the Medi-Witch continued talking, she found herself nodding unconsciously, the other woman's voice fading into a hum as she listed statistics and chances, each more depressing than the last. Hermione's eyes grew blank as she stared ahead, not really sure what she was supposed to do, or how to act. Her back was stiff and straight as she absorbed the information listlessly.\n","Ten per cent chance of recovery if we can reduce its growth… 6 months, maybe a year…\n","Rigorous treatment…\n","Side effects…nausea…vomiting…\n","High cost due to the rare nature of the ingredients…\n","\n","Hermione blinked and pulled herself out of her trance-like state as she absorbed the last detail like a shock to her system. \"Wh…what did you say?\"\n","Doctor Seeley cocked her head to the side and looked at her sympathetically.\n","\"The treatment is very expensive unfortunately. The ingredients are incredibly rare, and a single course of potions can cost around twenty thousand galleons.\"\n","Hermione felt a twisting sensation in her gut and for a brief moment she thought might actually be sick all over the witch's pristine white desk.\n","\"Twenty thousand galleons?\" she repeated dumbly, her face turning pale as her jaw clenched shut to stop herself from crying out.\n","\"Your medical insurance should be able to cover about 10% of that amount, so you'll only have to contribute another eighteen or so yourself.\"\n","\"Eighten?\" she echoed again, her voice hollow.\n","And then it was all over. The appointment came to an end with the professional witch rushing her through the details and making follow up appointments. She insisted that Hermione consider her choices quickly and return to book in a time to start her treatment once she was able to access her funds, urging her to start as soon a possible.\n","Hermione wandered from the office in a daze.\n","For a moment she couldn't even remember how to get out of the building, slowly retracing her steps through the endless winding corridors until she recognised a particularly dull painting of a herd of sheep in a wide green paddock. The shepherd gave her a cheerful wave as she hurried past, tipping his hat to her in a merry fashion.\n","Hermione picked up her pace, escaping through a set of large bronze doors and out into the entrance hall of the hospital. The air felt slightly cooler out here and she gulped in a few breaths as people rushed around her, going about their business as they jostled and bumped her shoulders. The blur of motion was too much and for a moment she leaned against a nearby railing, trying to draw breath into her lungs and failing miserably.\n","A cheerful gong sounded through the hall, reverberating from the tall grandfather clock next to the portrait of founder Mungo Bonham that graced the main wall of the entrance.\n","Hermione blinked at the clock in surprise.\n","Eight o'clock!\n","She gasped and clutched at her handbag, her heart skipping unpleasantly as she realised how late it was.\n","Sophie…\n","She had to get home. Hermione had left her daughter hours ago with a promise to return soon. The little girl was probably worrying herself sick over where her mummy had got to and what was the matter with her.\n","Oh god…Sophie…\n","No. She couldn't think about it now. Not now. Not in front of her daughter. There was no time for theatrics at the moment or silly displays of emotion. She just needed to get home.\n","Hermione rushed outside to the apparition point, drawing her wand into her clammy palm and trying desperately to focus on the location where she wanted to appear. She really hoped she didn't splinch herself.\n","With a crack she found herself outside her home and breathed a sigh of relief that she'd made it in one piece. Looking up at the little old cottage on the hill, Hermione felt herself shudder violently.\n","She clenched her hands into fists and focused on one thing and one thing only. Sophie.\n","Her daughter needed her. As she rallied herself and tried to control the trembling in her legs, Hermione made her way up the winding path to the front door of the cottage. The windows were cracked and there were tiles falling off the roof in several places. There was so much to do. They'd only just moved in. And even though the place was practically falling down around them, it was the best she could afford. Sophie needed a proper home. She was hoping she could fix it up and make it look nicer over time.\n","Ignoring the rotting wood on the front door, she gently turned the key, forcing it open when it got stuck halfway.\n","It was suspiciously quiet inside. The usual sounds of Sophie laughing and playing were not to be found. Hermione closed the door behind her, smelling something slightly burnt but still welcome coming from the kitchen.\n","\"Mione! You're back!\"\n","Hermione took a deep, steadying breath as she turned to face the curly haired smile of Lavender Brown. The girl was still strikingly pretty despite the deep scar the marred her left cheek, a cruel gift left to her by the werewolf Greyback during the final battle. Somehow, though, she still always managed to look both confident and glamorous anyway.\n","\"I'm so sorry Lav! I had no idea I'd be gone so long, and then I had to wait for ages-\"\n","\n","Lavender waved off her stream of apologies with a dainty hand, shrugging nonchalantly.\n","\"That's okay, silly! Everything's fine here. Sophie's just gone to bed actually. She waited up as long as she could, but the little squirt just couldn't keep her eyes open after a while. Don't worry, I gave her a bath and we've eaten dinner too. I'm a crap cook, but pasta was easy enough! I left you some under a stasis charm in the kitchen.\"\n","It took every bit of Hermione's strength not to break down sobbing in her friend's arms. Instead she just gave the other woman a huge bear hug, clinging onto her tighter than usual.\n","\"What did I ever do to deserve you?\" she whispered, practically shaking with the effort of keeping it together.\n","\"You mean apart from saving my life?\" Lavender joked, pulling back and observing her closely, \"No! Let's not start that argument again. I always win anyway. But you know we spent six years hating each other at school. It was about time we tried being nice to each other.\"\n","\"True. You've been my rock these last couple of years!\"\n","\"Well your kid is pretty cute,\" she joked, giving Hermione a light shove, \"and I guess you're alright too.\" Hermione laughed, but it came out a little choked, as if she couldn't quite breath properly.\n","\"Is everything alright? What did the doctor say?\" Lavender asked with a concerned frown.\n","Hermione dredged up enough courage from somewhere deep within to force a slightly strained smile onto her face. \"Everything's fine. She just said I was a bit malnourished. It seems I've skipped too many meals.\"\n","Lavender rolled her eyes.\n","\"You goose! I told you to look after yourself. You've been so stressed lately, what with having to find another job and… you know… everything else.\"\n","Hermione hummed sadly, trying not to think of the other problems looming in her life lest she break down completely. Luckily they were interrupted by a sleepy voice coming from the bedroom door.\n","\"Mummy?\"\n","Hermione forced a warm smile onto her lips, her heart clenching as she saw her daughter teetering in the doorway in her yellow pyjamas, rubbing tiredly at her eyes.\n","\"Hi sweetie,\" she whispered, moving her bag to the hook next to the door. Lavender gave her a quiet little wave. \"I'll see you this weekend!\" she mouthed, creeping past and out the front door.\n","\"Thanks Lav! You're the best,\" Hermione whispered back, before making her way over to her daughter. As she did, she heard her fried disapparating from out the front of the house and knew she was gone.\n","\"Hey sleepy head,\" she chuckled, bending down to sweep Sophie up into a tight cuddle. The little girl threw her arms around her neck, clinging on tightly.\n","\"You're late!\" she scolded in her drowsy voice.\n","\"Am I?\" she asked in a bewildered voice, \"But it's only 2 o'clock in the afternoon! It's still daylight!\" Sophie giggled, the sound muffled against Hermione's shoulder.\n","\"No it's not, mummy! It's dark outside!\"\n","\"Oh my goodness, you're right. In that case it's way past your bedtime, young lady.\" Sophie giggled again and burrowed in deeper to her arms.\n","\"Will you tuck me in? Auntie Lavender doesn't get the sheets right like you do.\"\n","\"Is that so?\" she mused, carrying her daughter into the bedroom and laying her gently on the low children's bed in there. It was the one piece of furniture she'd spent time and money transfiguring to be warm, cosy and to always bring her daughter joyful dreams. The yellow, sunny patchwork blanket was the only thing she'd kept from her parents' old house and it was a treasured item. Sophie couldn't sleep without it.\n","\"There we go,\" Hermione murmured softly as she placed her daughter under the blanket before tugging the sheets in tight around her. She pulled them taut and tucked them deeper into the bed frame.\n","\"Now you're snug as a bug!\"\n","Sophie laughed, wriggling her arms until they escaped the tight sheet and lay on top. \"You missed dinner mummy! Auntie Lavender's food tasted kinda funny.\"\n","Hermione clucked her tongue, tapping her daughter softly on the tip of her nose. \"Auntie Lavender was very kind to cook for you. I hope you said thank you.\"\n","\n","\"Yes mummy, I did.\"\n","Hermione stroked her hand over the little girl's hair, thankful that her daughter hadn't inherited the full bush of curls from her mother, just a few silky dark waves.\n","\"Are you feeling sleepy now, little bug?\"\n","\"Uhuh…\" Sophie hummed as her eyes started to droop. \"Well you'd better hurry up and pick a toy.\"\n","Sophie nodded, her little nose scrunching up as she thought about this very problem seriously.\n","\"You guess!\" she eventually declared with a cheeky smile, showing off a couple of missing baby teeth.\n","\"Hmmm,\" Hermione considered this solemnly, tapping one finger on her lips, \"I think Sophie wants to sleep with… umm…her\n","otter!\"\n","Sophie beamed, nodding enthusiastically. \"Yes please!\"\n","Hermione picked up the brown stuffed toy from the floor. Sophie immediately grasped it and held it close to her chest. It had been a gift from George Weasley when she turned two years old, and she loved it more than anything because it looked like her mummy's patronus.\n","\"Alright, sweetie. Time to dream. Say hello to the stars for me!\" Sophie smiled lethargically as her eyes closed.\n","\"And you say hello to the moon!\" she murmured in reply.\n","The familiar words tugged at Hermione's heartstrings. They'd been saying the same phrase to each other for as long as she could remember. Just like her mum used to do at bedtime when she was little.\n","With one final kiss to the little girl's forehead, Hermione quietly moved away from the bed, switching on the charmed lantern near the door to give the room a soft twinkling light.\n","She paused in the doorway, looking back on her baby girl sleeping peacefully in her bed. Watching Sophie sleeping, wrapped up securely in her sheets and clutching at her otter, Hermione felt the emotions finally come crashing down.\n","Making a hasty retreat, she hovered in the living room for a moment, her eyes moving over the half unpacked furniture still sitting around in a mess in the living room and trembled slightly. One of the couches needed replacing and she'd had to sell some of her parents' old paintings and rugs just last month, so there wasn't much to furnish the walls or floor with.\n","Eighteen thousand galleons…\n","Hermione's stomach clenched violentwowly again and before she knew it she was launching herself towards the front door and stumbling outside. Gulping for air, she barely made it to the patch of garden near the footpath before she was falling to her knees and vomiting the meagre contents of her stomach into the bushes.\n","It took her a while to recover, wiping her hand across her lips and spitting up the bile that had burned its way up her throat and into her mouth.\n","Sophie… my little Sophie…\n","There was no use holding back the wave of misery now, Hermione realised, as it swept through her like a bolt of ice.\n","The ice froze her heart and shattered it into a million pieces all at once as she whispered the bitter truth inside her head. She was dying.\n","Bellatrix Lestrange must be cackling beyond the grave, she thought with a deranged sob. The crazy bitch might not have killed her in person at Malfoy Manor, but now the consequences of her malice were coming back for revenge. The hour or two she'd spent writhing on their drawing room floor in pain was nothing compared to the total agony of what she was facing now.\n","Because now there was a tiny, innocent soul sleeping peacefully in her bed who relied on her mother completely. Now there was this precious life in her hands, who she loved more than anything in the world. And she didn't know what the hell she was supposed to do. Even if she could afford the potions she needed, there was still only the slimmest, most minute chance that she would defeat this.\n","Hermione collapsed forwards onto her hands, her face turning up to the sky as she howled with impotent rage, thankful for the silencing spells that protected Sophie from overhearing her despair.\n","She couldn't afford the potions anyway, so all the hope she might have held were instantly dashed.\n","Her poor, sweet Sophie had already endured so much in her short life-time. She'd already had to be so brave with each new trial they faced. She didn't deserve to lose her mum as well.\n","When Hermione had fallen pregnant, she'd been terrified but also delighted. The connection she'd felt to the baby inside her had been instant and so powerful.\n","\n","But Sophie's father, on the other hand, hadn't been as thrilled.\n","Viktor Krum had come back into her life like some kind of heroic angel after the war. He'd literally swept her off her feet. And maybe she'd been looking for love, or maybe she'd just needed to escape, but she'd happily gone with him back to Bulgaria where he'd continued his Quidditch career with roaring success while she studied her university courses by correspondence. He'd always admired her intelligence, after all, and he'd been so encouraging and supportive.\n","But he certainly hadn't counted on an unexpected pregnancy. He was at the height of his career, and they were still both so young. They weren't even anywhere near married yet, just dating happily and enjoying their time together after all the darkness she'd faced.\n","A sort of distance had grown between them those first few months of her pregnancy. But she'd always hoped that when the baby was born he'd come around. That he'd fall in love with their daughter like she already had.\n","Then the accident had happened and everything had changed.\n","He'd been out drinking with his team mates. He'd drunk a lot while she was pregnant. Hermione suspected that he was trying to drown his nagging doubts and pretend he was a bachelor again, with no family on the way to tie him down. But that was how the accident happened. He was completely pissed and flying his broom when he fell fifty feet and cracked his head on the stone turret of his old training ground.\n","He was dead within a couple of minutes.\n","While the whole of wizarding Bulgaria went into mourning, Hermione remembered just feeling numb about the whole thing, like maybe it hadn't really happened. People had tried to console her but she just couldn't bring herself to accept it. It had been too sudden. Too shockingly mundane to lose him to such a silly accident when she'd recently survived a war.\n","That was, until the first bill came in.\n","They'd been young and in love, and she'd just never worried about things as asinine as money. Viktor supposedly made a bloody good salary playing for his country. He was their star seeker after all.\n","But it seemed he liked gambling even more than he liked flying.\n","As more and more notices and demands came in, Hermione had been forced to confront the shocking revelation that Viktor owed an unfathomable amount of money to the bank. And goblins forgave nothing, not even after death.\n","It wasn't fair. They hadn't even been married, but apparently he'd filed some kind of paperwork for his club naming her as his next of kin, and she was pregnant with his offspring, so in some cruel twist of fate and Goblin law the debt fell to her.\n","And she had to pay.\n","So she'd gotten a job. And even as she ran herself ragged trying to work, still studying part time and seven months pregnant, she could barely afford to pay any of it back. Every time she managed to make a repayment it seemed she'd been charged more interest than she'd managed to return.\n","And now, four years later, she was still paying his debts and her credit rating was completely ruined.\n","She'd come so close. Only three thousand galleons remained of the original amount. And even after the company she was working for had closed down, she'd been incredibly lucky to find a new job. She was supposed to start next week.\n","But now…\n","Now she was dying. She was fucking dying.\n","And the only hope she had was a treatment that would cost another eighteen thousand galleons.\n","\"Why… oh god why, damnit?\" she screamed up at the stars, the same stars she had told her daughter to speak to in her dreams. Now they laughed down at her, taunting her.\n","Your daughter is going to be all alone. You've failed her. \"Are you happy, you bitch? Are you fucking happy?\"\n","She collapsed, tears streaming freely down her cheeks as she struggled to take in deep gasping breaths.\n","Hermione had always been a rational person, but nothing had prepared her to sort through the mess of thoughts swarming her now with panic, desolation and confusion fighting for control as she was forced to confront what was happening to her.\n","Even if she managed to pay off the last of Viktor's debts, who would look after Sophie? Her daughter would be left with nothing, not a single galleon to her name, with no mother, no family at all really, and a broken heart. She was only four years old for Merlin's sake!\n","It was too much.\n","Hermione found herself dry heaving again, her stomach so empty now she couldn't vomit. There wasn't even enough bile to expel from her body, so she just sat there curled up, her body convulsing as she tried to keep sucking in enough air to avoid losing consciousness.\n","Then, when the fit of emotion had passed and only exhaustion lay in its place, Hermione slumped back on the ground; her head feeling heavy like a great weight was anchoring it to the ground.\n","She stared up blearily at the stars above, wondering what else the cruel strings of fate had in store for her. It was clear she was entirely at their mercy now.\n","The only thing left to do was hide the awful truth from the little soul sleeping peacefully inside. There was nothing more important now than shielding her daughter from this terrible pain.\n","And by Merlin she'd do anything to protect her.\n","…\n","…\n","Well there it is. The first chapter. And a long one too! What a rollercoaster. Let me know what you think – as I said, it's a very different story!]\n","\"\"\"\n","#A Desperate Vow by Emara88.
